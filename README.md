PyPlayer

This is a ~~bucket~~ simple MP3 player written in [Python](Python.org). It’s in the name of it. It runs in Terminal, no GUI. (text based). Tested on mac, if you have Linux please tell me if it works.

Features

- Playing MP3 files (duh),
- Shuffle songs,
- Next, Previous song,
- Stop music, Continue music,
- Volume controls,
- Time elapsed,
- ~~SECRET SUPER HACKER MODE~~

Required Libraries

To install them, simply run

```pip install pygame keyboard```

How 2 Use

Controls:

N – Next song

P – Previous song

S – Stop song

-/+ - Change volume

Q – Quit

See! Really simple! Also, bc of keyboard, you need to run it with Admin or sudo. On mac you need to also enable Acessibility settings to Terminal, so the controls work.
