# PyPlayer

This is a ~~bucket~~ simple MP3 player written in [Python](Python.org). It’s in the name of it. It runs in Terminal, no GUI. (text based). Tested on **mac**, if you have **Linux** please tell me if it works. THis will of course will not replace VLC or anything like that, this is just a project.

# Features

- Playing MP3 files (duh),
- Shuffle songs,
- Next, Previous song,
- Stop music, Continue music,
- Volume controls,
- Time elapsed,
- ~~SECRET SUPER HACKER MODE~~.

# Required depencies

To install them, simply run

```pip install pygame keyboard```

# How 2 Use
In the **Main Menu** there are 4 options. 
- Play music
- Information
- Settings
- Quit

**Settings**: is of course, where you can set the tings of the program.
**Information**: shows the basic functions of the program.
**Quit**: Quits.
**Play music**: will first ask for the directory of the music and then show you the:
**Music Controls:**

N – Next song
P – Previous song
S – Stop menu
-/+ - Change volume
Q – Quit
Alt + F4 – Rage quit

See! Really simple! Also, because of keyboard, you need to run it with Admin or sudo. On mac you need to also enable Acessibility settings to Terminal, so the controls work. (in the music controls menu)
